Quickstart
==========

Install with ``pip install django-gdpr-assist``, add ``gdpr_assist`` to
Django's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` and add a ``gdpr_log`` definition to ``DATABASES``.

Then start adding privacy metadata to your models::

    class Comment(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
        age = models.IntegerField(null=True, blank=True)
        message = models.TextField()

        class PrivacyMeta:
            fields = ['name', 'age']
            search_fields = ['name']
            export_fields = ['name', 'age', 'message']

This will allow you to anonymise and export data in this model using the
standard gdpr-assist admin tool. You can also configure anonymisation or
deletion of a related model to trigger anonymisation of your model, and can
manually register a ``PrivacyMeta`` for third-party models without modifying
their code.

Anonymisation and deletion events for models registered with gdpr-assist are
logged for replay after a backup restoration with the ``gdpr_rerun`` management
command. When you need to work with a copy of the production data, there is
also the ``anonymise_db`` command, which will anonymise the whole database.
